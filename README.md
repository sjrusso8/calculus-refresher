# Calculus Refresher

The purpose of this repo is to refresh some of my mathematics knowledge but only using Python.  

The notebooks extends past just calculus and various python libraries. I am using *calculus* as a just a generic to mean any math topic above standard algrebra.

This repo is continually evolving as a I do various learnings in mathematics.  

## Topics to be covered

- [x] Basic Calculus
- [x] Basic Linear Algrebra
- [ ] Continued Linear Algrebra
    * Using Tensorflow
- [ ] Analytic Geometry
- [ ] Matrix Decomposition
- [ ] Vector Calculus
- [ ] Probability & Distributions
- [ ] Optimization
